    "# Challenge 5: Using 127 Qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on solving the previous challenges! You have shown that you can successfully use dynamic circuits.\n",
    "As a reward for making it this far you will be able to use one of our 127 qubit devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have seen before already that working with actual physical devices brings its own challenges.\n",
    "This is even more true when you want to use a big number of qubits, since paths can become long, and you have to make sure not to introduce too many errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge we want you to prepare a fully entangled 127 qubit state, the so called GHZ-state in a clever way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we will give you an outlook of how your previous knowledge of error correction could be applied in order to use such the 127 qubit GHZ-state in order to create a good 54 qubit GHZ-state. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use ibm_sherbrook as our device and use its even numbered qubits for the 54 qubit GHZ-state, which leaves the odd numbered qubits to be used as stabilizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Here we do use the same register for the odd and even qubits, even though they will be used differently. We do this, since it would make it quite a bit more complicated to creae the initial 127 qubit GHZ-state, especially when you want to optimize the depth manually.*"

Both of them can also apply to the stabilizers and we have to make sure to not introduce more noise by our attempts of correcting it, since that would beat the whole purpose. This might be less of a problem in the future, when the general error rate will go further down, but is still something which needs to be considered.\n",

Do we wait until the whole circuit is entangled? (This of course depends on which kind of errors we might want to correct). We can also think about resetting the stabilizers and create new ones later (using the same qubits) and use 2 phases in which we try to correct errors.\n",

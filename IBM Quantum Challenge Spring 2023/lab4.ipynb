    "## Classical Error Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why was error correction created in the first place? \n",
    "\n",
    "Think about talking to someone over the phone when you have bad reception. Despite your best efforts to speak clearly, sometimes the message gets changed or ruined. \"Let's put lunch with Fred on the schedule for Friday\" turns into \"Let's punch Fred on Friday\". Fred's weekend just got a whole lot worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you send a message, even one as simple as a bit, there is always the possibility for small errors to occur. If you send one bit of data over a wire, there may be a small chance that the bit is flipped, so instead of a `0` the recipient gets a `1`. This can happen more often if the cable is old and corroded. The same could potentially happen when storing data -- think of a CD getting scratched. In the worst case, errors could even happen during a computation in your processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The possibility of errors is a known problem for classical information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s  imagine that the chance of a bit accidentally being flipped (AKA error to occur) is 10%. This would mean that for each bit of data we send, there is a one-in-ten chance that the bit received is incorrect. You could send a message of `0` ten times, but the received message might read `0001000000`. You can see the problem already. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest solutions is using some repitition. My bit of data `1` can get encoded as `111`, and likewise a `0` gets encoded as `000`. Each bit of data is now encoded using three bits instead of just one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why does this help?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we now send `000` and error occurs, then the receiver might see 001. Since the receiver knows that the _should_ have gotten either 000 or 111, they could deduce that it was probably 000 that was sent, and a single bit got flipped. Errors, corrected! \n",
    "\n",
    "But what if multiple errors occur? Our message gets turned into `011` and the recipient now assumes we meant to send `111`. True error! By using the repitition, we reduce the chance that that happens, but we don't eliminate it. So how much do we reduce the error rate by, exactly? Let's investigate! \n",

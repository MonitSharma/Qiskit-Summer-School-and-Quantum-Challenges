# Solutions to Qiskit Challenges and Summer School

This repository contains my work on the Quantum Challenges organised by IBMs [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/).
This work includes the solutions to the Qiskit summer schools and all the challenges in between.



## About Qiskit
Qiskit is an open-source framework developed by IBM for programming quantum computers. It provides a rich set of tools, libraries, and resources to facilitate quantum computation research and education. With Qiskit, you can learn, simulate, and execute quantum circuits on real quantum hardware devices or simulators.

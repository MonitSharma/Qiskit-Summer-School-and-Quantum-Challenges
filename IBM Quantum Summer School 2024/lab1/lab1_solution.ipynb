    "Transpilation transforms a (potentially abstract) quantum computation to a *physical* quantum circuit that is compliant to a given quantum computer, i.e. can directly be executed by a suitable device (also called an [ISA circuit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/isa-circuits)).\n",
    "In order to yield a hardware-compliant quantum circuit, transpilation must define for each time step which physical resource of a quantum computer is performing what computation while considering that typically only a subset of qubits can interact in a specific way.\n",
    "This process is divided into two tasks:\n",
    "* Synthesis translates the quantum gates in an input quantum circuit to the set of quantum gates supported by the target quantum computer. The set of quantum gates supported by a target quantum computer is also called *basis gate set*. \n",
    "* Routing assigns the qubits of a quantum circuit to the qubits of a quantum computer in each time step. Whenever the qubit assignment changes, additional operations such as swap gates must be inserted into the quantum circuit. When the target quantum computer has a restricted *qubit connectivity*, the qubit assignment must change often to ensure that each quantum gate is only performed on qubits that are connected, i.e. qubits that can interact with each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "The transpilation process additionally optimizes the physical quantum circuit to increase the probability of obtaining the correct result.\n",
